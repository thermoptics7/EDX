#Write a while loop that continues to add 9 to mysteryValue until
#mysteryValue is greater than 100. Then, Print the result.
#For example: If mysteryValue was 88, the result would be 106.

#Do not edit the above code!

#Write your code here. When you run your code, we'll test it with a
#mysteryValue of 20. When you submit it, we'll test it with some other
#values.
